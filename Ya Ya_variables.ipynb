It belongs to a class of drugs called thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and helps improve insulin sensitivity in the body.\n","\n","**Acarbose**: Acarbose is an oral medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine, helping to control blood sugar levels.\n","\n","**Miglitol**: Miglitol is another oral medication used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that slows the breakdown of carbohydrates in the intestines, reducing the post-meal rise in blood glucose.\n","\n","**Troglitazone**: Troglitazone was a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. However, it has been withdrawn from the market due to concerns about liver toxicity.\n","\n","**Tolazamide**: Tolazamide is an oral medication used to lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. It belongs to the class of drugs known as sulfonylureas.\n","\n","**Examide**: Examide appears to be a less common or generic medication, and I couldn't find specific information about it. It's possible that it may be a less-known or less-commonly used diabetes medication.\n","\n","**Citoglipton**: Citoglipton also appears to be less common or generic, and specific information about it is not readily available. It might be a less-known medication or a misspelled term.\n","\n","(Sitagliptin is used along with diet and exercise and sometimes with other medications to lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally).)\n","\n","**Insulin**: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. In diabetes management, insulin is often used as a medication to supplement or replace the body's natural insulin production in individuals with type 1 diabetes and some cases of type 2 diabetes.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ctaUQxdn985r"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['rosiglitazone'].info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"OkRyGxtY12Aq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696024863429,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Ya Chu Hsu","userId":"17378520801624721445"}},"outputId":"ffd8efa3-1994-43d2-d2dc-ec349332c8ad"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n","RangeIndex: 101766 entries, 0 to 101765\n","Series name: rosiglitazone\n","Non-Null Count   Dtype \n","--------------   ----- \n","101766 non-null  object\n","dtypes: object(1)\n","memory usage: 795.2+ KB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#To determine the importance of each variable, we assess the percentage of patients who use **rosiglitazone, acarbose, miglitol, tolazamide, examide, citoglipton, and insulin** as their medication.
